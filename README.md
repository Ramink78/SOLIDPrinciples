# SOLIDPrinciples

## **Single Responsibility**

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## **Open/Closed**

You should be able to extend a class's behavior, without modifying it.

## **Liskov Substitution**

Child classes should never break the parent class’s type definitions.

## **Interface Segregation**

Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use.

## **Dependency Inversion**

 1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both
    should depend on abstractions. 
   
 2. Abstraction should not depend upon
        details.
